      <p>Hello, thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio! My name is Dylan Shoemaker and I love solving puzzles. I've always wanted to know how something works, how it can be broken and how it can be fixed. 
      <br></br>The main thing I love about web design is that you get to make your own puzzle. Some puzzles are easy to solve, some are a bit more difficult, but I’ve never found a puzzle I have not enjoyed solving. I’m an avid fan of technology and software; on my quest to never be bored I'm constantly researching and learning how to make the most of all the tools that we have to make magic happen on our screens.
