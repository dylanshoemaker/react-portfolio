          Hello, thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio! My name
          is Dylan Shoemaker and I love solving puzzles. I've always wanted to
          know how something works, how it can be broken down into individual
          pieces and how it can be put back together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m an avid fan of technology and software and my goal in life is to
          learn as much as I can about the technology that fuels how we interact
          with the world around us. I've recently obtained a Certificate in Full
          Stack Web Development from the University of Utah and I'm currently looking
          for any career opportunities with a company thats goal is to make a difference
          or to solve a problem.
        </p>
