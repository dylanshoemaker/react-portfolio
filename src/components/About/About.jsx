                  Hello, thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio!
                  My name is Dylan Shoemaker and I love solving puzzles. I've
                  always wanted to know how something works, how it can be
                  broken down into individual pieces and how it can be put back
                  together.
                </strong>
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Iâ€™m an avid fan of technology and software and my goal in life
                is to learn as much as I can about the technology that fuels how
                we interact with the world around us. I've recently obtained a
                Certificate in Full Stack Web Development from the University of
                Utah and I'm currently looking for any career opportunities with
                a company thats goal is to make a difference or to solve a
                problem.
